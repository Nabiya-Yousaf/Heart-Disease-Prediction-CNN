# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using CNNs  

This repository contains my MSc Data Science dissertation project (University of Essex, 2025), focusing on **predicting heart disease using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  

---

## 📌 Overview  
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide. This project investigates the potential of **deep learning models, specifically CNNs**, for predicting heart disease from patient data.  

- **Dataset:** Kaggle Heart Disease dataset (UCI Cleveland dataset variant)  
- **Techniques Used:** Data preprocessing, feature selection, CNN architectures (1D CNN, MLP+CNN, RNN+CNN features)  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  

---

## 🎯 Research Questions  
1. How effectively can CNNs predict heart diseases using patient data?  
2. What is the impact of preprocessing techniques on prediction accuracy?  
3. How do demographic and lifestyle factors influence CNN predictive power?
